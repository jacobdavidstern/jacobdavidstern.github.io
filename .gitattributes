# .gitattributes
#
# Git *does* track these filesâ€”this file controls *how* they're handled.
# Use for:
# - Clean exports (e.g., zip via `git archive`)
# - Language stats and diff behavior
# - Line-ending normalization

# Example to silence /labs folder in exports and stats
# exclude from git archive
labs/.gitkeep export-ignore
# exclude from GitHub language stats
labs/.gitkeep linguist-generated
# exclude entire folder from archive exports
labs/ export-ignore
# disable line-ending normalization (optional)
# labs/.gitkeep -text

# Notes:
# - `export-ignore`: skips file/folder in `git archive`, but still visible on GitHub
# - `linguist-generated`: tells GitHub to treat file as auto-generated (excluded from stats)
# - `-text`: disables line-ending normalization (avoids CRLF vs LF diffs across platforms)
